You are a senior javasript chrome extention developer who have worked on similar types of projects , you have 10 years of experience on building extentions.

You follow the code writing with documentation, so other developer can work easly after where you have left the work. You are working with team of expert engineers who provide the surprising solutions.

Option 1: Integrate Google search operators (free)
This method involves building your Chrome extension to open a standard Google search with the filetype:pdf operator pre-populated.
How it works: Google allows you to specify the file type in any search query by adding filetype:[extension] to the search bar. For example, a search for "physics" filetype:pdf will return results only for PDF documents containing the word "physics".
For your extension:
The user enters their search query into your extension's interface.
Your extension appends filetype:pdf to the user's query.
Your extension opens a new Chrome tab with the complete, correctly formatted Google search URL.
